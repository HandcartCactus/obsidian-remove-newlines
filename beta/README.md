How to install and test the v1.0.7 beta as a remove-newlines user:

1. Download all three files from this folder (not including the README)
2. Close Obsidian.md if it is open.
3. Go to \<YourVaultFolder\>/.obsidian/plugins/remove-newlines
4. Replace the three files there with the files you just downloaded
5. Open Obsidian.md and test out the plugin!

Please note: I haven't changed the version in manifest.json so it will still look like you have v1.0.6 installed.
