How to install and test the v1.0.7 beta as a remove-newlines user:

1. Download the [`main.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HandcartCactus/obsidian-remove-newlines/refs/heads/main/beta/main.js) file from this folder
2. Close Obsidian.md if it is open.
3. Go to \<YourVaultFolder\>/.obsidian/plugins/remove-newlines
4. Replace the `main.js` file there with the `main.js` file you just downloaded
5. Open Obsidian.md and test out the plugin!

Please note: It will still look like you have v1.0.6 installed.
